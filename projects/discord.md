### *Why did I join?*
I've heard about Discord all the time. My friends played games a lot, and it was a good way to communicate with anyone. But, I don't really play games because I know I get too obssesed. So, I simply don't play any games (except phone games). The irony here is that I actually joined because the University of Hawaii offers a Game Dev club, branched from the ACM program. I wanted to really check them out and see what they do, but the creators of the club announced events or meetingd through [Discord](https://discordapp.com/). So, this time, I had to sign up and join the Discord. 

### *Why is joining it any good?*
It's mostly because I get to make friends who are in the same major as me. They are very nice and friendly, and you can directly message if you have any questions. It shows who's the admin and who's in charge of certain things. Another good thing is that there are senior students who could help me and tutor me to be better student in my classes. I talked to many people on the first day I joined Discord and joined the ACM channel. People messaged me, too, to welcome me into the club, which I thought was really sweet.

##### *Do you want to join?*
you can join the UH Manoa ACM channel through [here](https://discordapp.com/invite/hUANusC).
