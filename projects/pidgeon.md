### *How can you become friends with birds?*
Food! (not for you though, for them) As most of us know, birds love rice. *Any type of rice*. Maybe most of us never carries some random rice with us because we have better things to do. However, if you are lonely and want to make friends with birds, like pidgeons, you should carry some rice with you. You can put the rice in a [Ziploc bag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziploc), and then go to a park or pond. Find a spot where birds are hanging out. They will fly away as you come close, but the trick is, you have to walk slow when you approach them, letting them know you're not trying to catch them and kill them. Pull out little bit of rice and throw it as far away from yourself. The reason being, birds never want to come close to you until they're comfortable with you. They're extremely cautious and can catch the slightest movement, and if you respect their space, they will like you for it. Each time they finish the handful, you throw it little bit closer, and closer. Some will remain at distance, but you will notice, some already trust you. Don't be upset over the ones at distance, istead be happy about the ones close to you. They trust you, so you should be happy. If you keep doing this, you might just become the [Pidgeon Lady](https://keyassets-p2.timeincuk.net/wp/prod/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2017/12/Bird-Lady-Home-Alone-630x473.jpg) from [Home Alone 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Alone_2:_Lost_in_New_York).

### *Why should you be friends with birds?*
Good question. Why are you still friends with someone who hurt you? Instead of being friends with them, it is better to friends with birds. Because they are just living their life, never there to hurt you. If anything, they bring smile to your face. At the same time, if you've never noticed, pidgeons and birds, they walk really funny. There are many times I just giggled once I see a bird walking around. Their heads go back and forth, pretty much every direction to stay stable. Sometimes they jump, especially the smaller ones, and it's cute to watch them do that. You should try it out. And, in [Mongolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolia), they consider feeding the birds a good deed and it brings you good luck. They believe that animals that live in the sky, are higher than human beings, therefore they are closer to the gods. They believe that if you feed many birds, you will have many "good note" from the birds, delivering to the gods. Maybe before you take that exam, feed some bird. 

### *Did you know a bird called Plover fly from Alaska to Hawaii every Spring and Autumn?*
They are such a tiny bird, but they fly acros the Pacific. You might spot them here and there, and if you're feeling good, give them a hand. They deserve it. If you want to know more about this bird, you can check [this out](https://phys.org/news/2011-06-plovers-tracked-pacific.html).

That's the end of it, thank you for reading! Here's a small checklist for you if you decide to make friends with birds:
* Any type of rice 
* A bag for the rice
* Find a spot with birds
* Have fun and make friends with funny walking birds
