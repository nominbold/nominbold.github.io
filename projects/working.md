summary: Working as a tutor helped me understand lot of things as a student and a teacher. Everyone has a different need when it comes to learning, and everyone has a different method of learning.

Tutoring someone is just hard, not because the subject is hard, but finding a way to explain the subject in such matter that is easy to understand for the student. When I started the tutoring job, I thought I would be really good at it. I was known for my math skills, so I was recommended as a tutor by my teacher. I thought, I would probably be the best tutor for math because I understto every aspect of math, therefore it shouldn't be too hard to explain it. Boy, was I wrong. When I started working, I was probably the worst explainer. People avoided sessions with me and reserved time with my fellow workers. I didn't know what I was doing wrong. At first, they seemed mean because my English wasn't perfect enough for them and they would say hurtful things.  As I worked with different kinds of students, I learned many things about teaching and learning methods.

When I get a new student walking into the tutoring center, they often have a mindset that they are not good at that subject and they think they are bound to fail their classes. Most of the students who come into the tutoring center were adults, with full time jobs and family to take care of. They had dropped out of school at a young age, and they're coming back to school to improve their lives. They had forgotten most of the things they learned, and they're fearful of the homework, the quizzes, and the exams. As a tutor, it's harder to work with people like that because they kept thinking they can't do this because it's hard. But, on the other hand, I have the power to change that. I try my best to show that it's not that hard if you understand what is happening. Math becomes easier if you understand it rather than memorizing formulas or methods. I try to show that, and I try to show what they can do as long as they understand the subject. The tricky part was that how do I show them or make them understand it in a simple way?

As I became tutor, I understood that everyone learns differently. Anyone can learn anything as long as it is presented in way that they understand it more.
