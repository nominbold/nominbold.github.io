### *and patience makes it possible.*
When it comes to creating something into reality, it can be difficult. If you don't have much experience in something, it is likely that you're going to have a hard time. However everyone and anyone can change that by practicing and learning something new everyday. It's important to be patient and to understand that nothing is going to happen overnight. Proccess is something most people hate, but it should be your best friend. I personally hated waiting, hated being stuck in a traffic, and hated that I had to sit down and learn it to do better. But, I've come to realize that I needed patience to do good in everything. We all know that engineering in general is hard becuase you have to think about lots of things to create something useful. Andn it is the same for software engineering, you do have to do lots of thinking while you design the program in your head. It's hard, but that doesn't mean I (or you) can't do it. We can do it. 

### *Be consistent with your schedule*
Being consistent is challenging for anyone, and that's when patience comes in. What helps me stay patient and consistent is having a calendar. I write down what I need to do for the whole day, and I try my best to finish all of them. And, having a goal list for the day keeps me focused on the goal, and at the end of the day, I feel accomplished.
