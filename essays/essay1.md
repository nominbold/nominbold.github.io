### *and patience makes it possible.*
When it comes to creating something into reality, it can be difficult. If you don't have much experience in something, it is likely that you're going to have a hard time. However everyone and anyone can change that by practicing and learning something new everyday. It's important to be patient and to understand that nothing is going to happen overnight. Proccess is something most people hate, but it should be your best friend. I personally hated waiting, hated being stuck in a traffic, and hated that I had to sit down and learn it to do better. But, I've come to realize that I needed patience to do good in everything. We all know that engineering in general is hard becuase you have to think about lots of things to create something useful. Andn it is the same for software engineering, you do have to do lots of thinking while you design the program in your head. It's hard, but that doesn't mean I (or you) can't do it. We can do it. 

### *Be consistent with your schedule*
Being consistent is challenging for anyone, and that's when patience comes in. What helps me stay patient and consistent is having a calendar. I write down what I need to do for the whole day, and I try my best to finish all of them. And, having a goal list for the day keeps me focused on the goal, and at the end of the day, I feel accomplished. Another thing is to limit your social media and watching entertainment less than your usual. In today's world, it's easy to forget time when you are in the internet pool. One thing always leads to another. Same thing with being succesful and accomplished. If you do something, there will always be a result to your doing. 

### *Read more*
Though reading is least favorite thing for most people, it does get easier as you read more. Reading is the best way to learn something new, and applying what you learned to something you are doing is growing as a person. Reading is always good, but what you read is important, too. I have a friend who is obsessed with reading textbooks. It's became his hobby, so whenever he has time, he reads textbooks on software engineering, data analysis, hacking cars, etc. He exceeds in his class, and he knows more than what he's required to know for the class. I'm not saying that reading textbooks should be your hobby, but it should be at least an option in your head sometime later.

### *Understanding instead of memorizing*
I have taken math classes with joy written all over my face, and it's because I understand math instead of memorizing formulas. I can barely recite the multiplication table, but I can figure out the area under/over a crazy graph going to infinity. I excel only because I understand what is happening. It can be hard to understand certain things on your own, but that's why there are teachers and TAs. They're there to explain and help you understand what they understand. As my ICS 311 teacher, Nodari said, "You can only teach something if you understand it." So I suggest getting help from your teacher, TAs, and tutors to understand the concepts, instead of memorizing definitions.
