## *Overview*
*The problem*: There are many activities hosted by lots of different
clubs that not all of the UH Manoa students have access to, such as 
self defense classes, kickboxing, or painting events.

*The solution*: By using the website, students are able to see upcoming
events hosted by all the clubs among the UH Manoa, and 
the can register for the event and see/leave review for the events hosted.

## *Approach*
The purpose of the website is that it keeps the events hosted by clubs
available to every students in the UH system, not just the club members. 
The only requirement for the events to be posted is that
the events have to be hosted by UH registered clubs, and the website
only serves a purpose of letting the students know when and where
the events are happening. The site offers the students who participated
the events to leave a review, so that if it's hosted again in the 
future, new users can see how the event goes, as well as club presidents
can look at the review to improve their events for their future events. 

## *Mockup page ideas*
Some possible mockup pages include:
* Landing page
* Sign up / Sign in button
* User / Admin home page
* User / Admin profile page
* Upcoming Events page
* Review page
* Event Request page
* Admin only : Add Event page >> available to club presidents
* Admin only : Delete Review page >> in case it's inappropriate 

## *Use case ideas*
What should happen while the user is using the website:
* New user can sign up, log in, and ends up on the landing page
* Admin / old users can log in, and ends up at the landing page as well
* *Landing* page has information about the website in general
* *Upcoming Events* page has events hosted by clubs
  * User can register for events
* *Reviews* page will allow the students to look at reviews of old events.
* *Event Request* page will allow students to leave a request for 
events for specific club or all clubs
* *User Profile* page
  * shows what clubs they are in
  * leave review for events they participated

## *Beyond the basics*
After implementing the basic function of the website, here are some 
ideas for more advanced features:
* **Join a Club** page >> allowing students to join clubs
* **Reviews** page >> notifying students if they 'favorite' events that
it's being hosted again soon. 
* **Contact a Club** page >> allowing students to contact the club
presidents for questions or requests
* **Event Request** page >> making sure that if one club chooses to 
host a event request, other clubs can't host it unless they cancel
the event. 
* If a students register for an event, and the event is **cancelled**, 
it would notify the students that it's being cancelled.
* If a students register for an event, and the event **location** 
or **time** has changed, it would notify the students that what's
changed.
* If a student request for an event, and the event is chosen to be 
hosted, it would notify the student that which club is planning to 
host it.
