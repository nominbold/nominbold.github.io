There's a certain need for web developers just because they all seem to know the magic behind making everything look fancy and clean. However, Semantic UI is the next level tool for any programmers to create fancy web application without a hassle. It might be a hassle to learn the syntax and how to use the semantic UI, but I'm telling you that it's really worth it. After fiddling with the semantic UI, things became more clear, and I could have myself a nice looking web page within 20 minutes. For my class, we were required to take the _Semantic UI 2.0_ class at [Plural Sight](https://www.pluralsight.com/), and it had very clear and throughly thought out lessons.
