### *The seriousness of this pandemic*
I learn a lot about biology and micro-organisms on my own, and
I know how serious this COVID-19 is. People say "Look on the 
bright side! There are a lot of recovery cases." but sadly we 
have no medication or vaccine for it that it's not guaranteed
that most people would recover from this highly contagious virus. 
Only thing I can do to help as a student is to stay home to 
minimize the spread of the virus. And there's an importance to 
staying home, too, because the symptoms don't get noticed until
much later, therefore causing people to think they're safe and 
they spread it to more people. Then those people, who
don't know they're infected, think they're fine and spread it 
to many more people. The coronavirus cases are increasing in the 
US only because people are not taking the quarantine seriously, 
therefore making things worse. For the safety of our family, 
our friends, and others, we have to stay home no matter how much
we want to leave the house (unless it's essential).

### *Stay Home*
Luckily, most of my class were either inverted or online, so there
wasn't too much change to my school schedule. However, it was
different for my job. I'm a tutor at Honolulu Community College, 
but the school decided that they can't pay for the student workers
unless they are in the facility. It's little bit unfair because
we can still help students with Zoom or tutor.com, but I am not 
getting paid because I refused to leave home. I'm only doing this
so that I would contribute to minimizing the spread of the virus, 
plus I don't want to get sick or get my loved ones sick as well.
I don't know how it's affecting my students because they're getting
the help with their classes. 

### *More time for myself*
Even though, what's happening right now is not that happy matter, 
I think students are getting more sleep, which is very important. 
Before the quarantine started, I used to bus to school and work, 
which is slow and has long travel time. However, now I don't have
to do all that, and I have more time to study and do my homework.
Basically, there's no time wasted unless I decide to do nothing. 
I started working out at home, which was not at all possible 
when I had school and work, and homework piled one after another.
I can take a nap whenever I want, which helps me with studying for
a longer time. I cook my own healthy meal instead of not really 
eating anything throughout the day.
