### *The seriousness of this pandemic*
I learn a lot about biology and micro-organisms on my own, and
I know how serious this COVID-19 is. People say "Look on the 
bright side! There are a lot of recovery cases." but sadly we 
have no medication or vaccine for it that it's not guaranteed
that most people would recover from this highly contagious virus. 
Only thing I can do to help as a student is to stay home to 
minimize the spread of the virus. And there's an importance to 
staying home, too, because the symptoms don't get noticed until
much later, therefore causing people to think they're safe and 
they spread it to more people. Then those people, who
don't know they're infected, think they're fine and spread it 
to many more people. The coronavirus cases are increasing in the 
US only because people are not taking the quarantine seriously, 
therefore making things worse. For the safety of our family, 
our friends, and others, we have to stay home no matter how much
we want to leave the house (unless it's essential). 

We are about to hit 1 Million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide
